@article{Souza2014,
abstract = {In this article, I describe the application of advanced analytics techniques to supply chain management. The applications are categorized in terms of descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics and along the supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model domains plan, source, make, deliver, and return. Descriptive analytics applications center on the use of data from global positioning systems (GPSs), radio frequency identification (RFID) chips, and data-visualization tools to provide managers with real-time information regarding location and quantities of goods in the supply chain. Predictive analytics centers on demand forecasting at strategic, tactical, and operational levels, all of which drive the planning process in supply chains in terms of network design, capacity planning, production planning, and inventory management. Finally, prescriptive analytics focuses on the use of mathematical optimization and simulation techniques to provide decision-support tools built upon descriptive and predictive analytics models.},
